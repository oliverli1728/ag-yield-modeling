Hybrid model (ridge regression for trend, gradient boosted regression on residuals using dynamically weighted features) estimation of agricultural yields, currently available for corn, soybean and winter wheat. Can be modified (with some brief finetuning) to include more crops, as most data is gathered via API. Includes maturity/harvest and satellite (NDVI - accumulated) data. Additional variables include those from USDA quickstats and geospatial (drought index).
